A currated list of DoH and DoT FQDNs, you can use the included Shell script to "scrape" the IPs and generate your own list

Recently added https://github.com/curl/curl/wiki/DNS-over-HTTPS FQDN list - massive update, will eventually automate import of FQDNs

Notes:
Requires 'dig' or 'drill' to resolve FQDNs to IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
Puts all resolved IPs (v4 and v6) into the same list
